Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 processor is still a great laptop for most people, despite being a bit old, and Best Buy has discounted it to $599 ($200 off). It has the same design as the M4 MacBook Air, and comes with 16GB of RAM. The 15-inch MacBook Air with M4 is $949 ($250 off) at Best Buy and Amazon — the same discount as the 13-inch. It’s much the same excellent computer as the 13-inch version, just with a bigger screen, more battery life, and better speakers. Read our review . Apple AirTags Apple’s AirTags are unobtrusive, waterproof, and tap into the massive Find My network for out-of-range locating. Where to Buy: $29 $17.97 at Amazon $29 $17.97 at Walmart $99 $62.99 at Amazon (four-pack) If you need to sizable step up in power for a Mac laptop, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro processor is down to $1,699 ($300 off) at Amazon . It has a 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU, 512GB SSD like the base M5 model, but 24GB of RAM and faster Thunderbolt 5 ports. You can also step up to a bigger and beefier 16-inch version with a 14-core / 20-core M4 Pro chip, 48GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD for $2,499 ($400 off) at Best Buy and Amazon . The Mac Mini is one of the best bargains available if you want a lot of computing power in a wildly small desktop. The base M4 model is down to $479 ($120 off) at Best Buy and Amazon , which is just $10 shy of its all-time low. Meanwhile, the more powerful M4 Pro version is going for $1,249.99 ($150 off) at Amazon , which is also one of its better prices to date. If you already have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, there’s no better deal for this kind of power. Read our review . Apple MacBook Pro 14 (2025, M5) The M5-equipped MacBook Pro is mostly a chip bump from the M4 model of 2024. But it remains an excellent choice for beginners and students in creative fields.

Read our review. You can pick up the 40mm Apple Watch SE (second-gen) with GPS at Walmart starting at $129 ($120 off), which is a new low price (the 44mm variant is also on sale starting at $159 ). If you’re on a tight budget, the last-gen Apple Watch SE is still worth considering. It lacks some of Apple’s newer sensors and doesn’t offer an always-on display, but it remains relatively fast, given that it uses the same chipset as the Apple Watch Series 8. It also provides all the essentials, including daily activity and sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, fall and crash detection, and access to the newer Vitals app in watchOS 26. Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS) Although the Apple Watch Series 11 is the same size as its predecessor, it features a 5G cellular modem, a display that’s twice as durable, and slightly improved battery life.

The great-sounding speaker can play Dolby Atmos tracks with proper separation, though you can also pair two together for even better separation. The speaker doesn’t support Bluetooth, which means your device has to be on the same network to stream music to it. You can also ask Siri to play tunes, control various smart home accessories, set timers, or answer questions, but all of those functions still require a stable internet connection. Read our review . The latest 11-inch iPad Pro has only been out for about a month, but that hasn’t stopped Amazon from cutting the price of the 256GB / Wi-Fi model to $899 ($100 off).

The upgrades to the new Apple Watch Ultra 3 are relatively minor, so you may as well save as much as possible if you want Apple’s most rugged smartwatch. The Ultra 2 comes in one size — 49mm — and is geared more toward athletic types. It also features a bright display and fantastic battery life, though the Ultra 3 can last longer between charges. iPad Mini (2024) The seventh-gen iPad Mini comes with Apple’s A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence. It’s also compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and offers faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds. Read our review .

Instead of sitting in your ear canal, the earbuds cling to your outer ear like a piece of jewelry. That design means you’ll always hear external noise, which isn’t ideal if you want to block out noisy coworkers; however, it’s great if you need to remain aware of your surroundings, such as when walking or riding a bike. Read our review . The Google Pixel Buds 2A are currently on sale for an all-time low of $99 ($30 off) at Amazon , Best Buy , and the Google Store .

Technics’ EAH-AZ100s are a premium pair of wireless earbuds currently available for an all-time low of around $219.99 ($80 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo . The earbuds’ key feature is that they support three-device multipoint audio, so you can switch between a trio of sources seamlessly.

Where to Buy: $799.99 $649.99 at Best Buy Microsoft’s flagship 13-inch Surface Pro is also receiving a big discount, selling for as low as $749.99 ($450 off) at Microsoft with a 10-core Snapdragon X Plus chip, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD. It’s quite a deal, though the keyboard and stylus are sold separately. The convertible tablet has great battery life and solid performance. We’re currently testing the 14-inch HP OmniBook 5 and liking it, especially for the value it offers. It’s very affordable for a laptop with an OLED display and marathon battery life, and it’s around $519.99 ($180 off MSRP) at Amazon and direct from HP . Its base Snapdragon X1 Plus chip isn’t very speedy, but it’s manageable if you’re not going too wild on multitasking. But the star of the show is this nice 1920 x 1200 OLED panel for such a low, low price. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025) Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 is the go-to choice for a portable gaming machine that’s great at regular laptop duties. It’s got a lovely OLED display, great keyboard and trackpad, and solid battery life. The base model with RTX 5060 graphics is fairly thin at around 0.63 inches, while the highest-end model with RTX 5070 Ti is a little thicker. Where to Buy: $1799.99 $1299.99 at Best Buy (5060) $2399.99 $1999.99 at Best Buy (5070 Ti) The base Asus ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop with a last-gen Intel Raptor Lake 14650HX CPU, RTX 5060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD is $1,199.99 ($300 off) at Amazon . For a higher-end model that doesn’t skyrocket in price, the Strix G16 with AMD Ryzen 9 8940HX and RTX 5070 Ti is $1,599.99 ($400 off) at Best Buy . Strix models are much chunkier than their ROG Zephyrus cousins, but they’re a better deal if you prioritize performance over portability. Lenovo Legion Pro 7i (16-inch, Intel) Lenovo’s Legion Pro 7i is a well built gaming laptop with a lovely 2.5K OLED display and a powerful RTX 5080 GPU, enough to handle 4K gaming on an external monitor. Its only major downsides are a lack of face or fingerprint unlocking and Lenovo’s tendency to pre-load some annoying bloatware. Where to Buy: $3499 $2299 at B&H Photo (RTX 5080, 2TB SSD) The Lenovo Legion 7i above is one of our preferred gaming laptops if you like a beefy boy with high-end RTX 5080 graphics, but a solid alternative for less is the similarly-specced HP Omen Max 16 . The Omen Max 16 with RTX 5080 graphics, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD is just $1,899.99 ($1,400 off) direct from HP . It’s also at Best Buy with a 2TB SSD for $2,474.99 $2,559.99 ($600 off) , but the one at HP is the screaming deal that you should nab before it’s gone (you can always do your own SSD upgrade later). If you want a cheap(er) OLED-equipped Lenovo laptop, check out the Yoga Slim 7x at Best Buy , where you can grab it for $749.99 ($550 off). It’s got 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a Snapdragon X Elite processor that’s speedy and battery-efficient. Just make sure to check whether any specialized software you require is Windows on Arm-compatible. While not a gaming laptop, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i Aura Edition is a fairly thin (though not-so-light) productivity machine that can dabble in content creation thanks to its RTX 5060 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD. It also has a 3200 x 2000 resolution OLED display and is on sale for Cyber Monday at Best Buy , where you can pick it up for $1,649.99 ($550 off). Razer Blade 16 (2025, RTX 5090) Razer’s latest and greatest version of its Blade 16 laptop returns to a thinner, more travel-friendly chassis. It comes with RTX 50-series GPU options but each configuration features an excellent OLED display. Read our review .

It’s the base model with a non-touch OLED display, 12GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and the power-sipping MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 processor. The higher-end $749 model with a touchscreen that we tested for our review is slightly better, but these kinds of Chromebooks rarely go on sale. Gaming deals Nintendo Switch 2 The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 7.9-inch LCD display, magnetically attached Joy-Con 2 controllers, backwards compatibility with most original Switch games, and exclusive titles including Donkey Kong Bananza and Kirby Air Riders. Read our review . Where to Buy: $499.99 $449.99 at Best Buy (Mario Kart World bundle) Sony DualSense Edge Sony’s pro-style controller, the DualSense Edge, might suffer from shorter battery life than the standard DualSense model, but it features great software integration with the PlayStation 5 and plenty of customizable components. Read our review . Where to Buy: $199.99 $169.99 at Best Buy $199.99 $169.99 at PlayStation Direct Nintendo’s Black Friday discounts are still available, allowing you to save $30 on several fantastic Switch titles that every owner should consider playing. Games like Super Mario Odyssey are $30 instead of $60 . Some of these price drops aren’t unprecedented, but the timing is good if you’re getting a Switch 2, as some titles have free Switch 2 upgrades that boost visual fidelity. Also, many of the Zelda -themed amiibo that launched alongside Nintendo’s new console are just $10, down from $30. Walmart has discounted the G7 HE Wired Xbox Controller to $37.04 ($22 off) when you clip the on-page coupon, which is a new low. The wireless controller features drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, Hall effect magnetic triggers, and Hall effect analog triggers. You can use GameSir’s Nexus app (available on PC and the Xbox store) to remap buttons and make other adjustments to optimize it for your favorite games. Microsoft’s official Xbox Wireless Controller is still on sale at Amazon , Walmart , and Best Buy starting at $39.99 ($25 off) for Cyber Monday. It doesn’t have bells and whistles like programmable buttons or RGB lighting, but in our experience, it’s one of the most reliable controllers around. Its batteries don’t need to be swapped out very often, and that inconvenience is outweighed by not having to plug in a wire every time you want to play a game. Meta Quest 3S The Meta Quest 3S is a battery-powered standalone VR headset runs the same chipset as the pricier Quest 3, along with the lenses and screen resolution as the Quest 2. It can also be connected to a PC to play VR games like Half-Life Alyx. Read our review .

Right now, it’s down to $899 at Amazon , which is a big drop from its usual price of $1,299 (nobody tell Nathan Edwards ). The Backbone Pro can turn any smartphone or smaller tablet with a USB-C port into a more effective handheld, and it’s fallen to a new low of $134.99 ($35 off) at Amazon , Best Buy , and Backbone’s online store . The controller has an Xbox-like button layout, plus a pair of remappable rear buttons. It’s also compatible with games available on the App Store and Google Play Store, as well as cloud-based titles that are streamable via Xbox Game Pass. The Pro is Backbone’s first controller to support Bluetooth, too, which allows you to use it with everything from a Stream Deck to the latest smart TVs. If you have (or soon plan to buy) a Nintendo Switch 2, you may need a microSD Express card if you foresee quickly expanding beyond the console’s internal 256GB of storage, as it’s the only kind of storage you can run Switch 2 games off of. Fortunately, Samsung’s 512GB P9 is down to its lowest price yet, selling for $74.99 (was $99.99) at Amazon . Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch The Nintendo Switch 2 has 256GB of storage, but that won’t get you very far if you’ve built up a medium-sized digital game library. Samsung’s Nintendo-branded 256GB microSD express card doubles the console’s available storage. It doesn’t require any tools to install, games stored on the microSD express card will run virtually identically to those saved on the Switch 2’s onboard storage.

If you’ve ever wanted to explore a galaxy far, far away, you can pick up the limited edition version for the PS5 or Xbox Series X at Amazon for just $19.99. The game puts you in the boots of low-level criminal Kay Vess as you tackle high-risk jobs across multiple planets. While the game doesn’t shake up the open-world genre, it’s set in an incredible universe that feels perfectly like Star Wars . Read our review . PlayStation 5 Pro The “pro” version of Sony’s PlayStation 5 has a bigger GPU, new PSSR AI-based upscaling, advanced ray tracing, and 2TB SSD (with expandable storage).

To win in this card game, players must be the first to collect three property sets using cards that correspond to spaces on the Monopoly board. There are no dice to roll like there are in the board game, but action cards let you collect rent, steal, or swap properties to get ahead. It also takes about 45 minutes to play, which is far more approachable than an actual game of Monopoly. Happy Salmon is currently matching its all-time low of $6.50 (about $7 off) at Amazon .

If you’re planning to gift an Apple device this holiday season — or treat yourself — time is now running out t o take advantage of the latest Cyber Monday promos. The annual shopping holiday is already down to its final hours, and we’re starting to see some items go up in price or out of stock. That’s a shame, given that the current batch of Apple deals is one of the best we’ve seen all year across several categories. Despite having recently launched, for instance, the new AirPods Pro , Apple Watch Series 11 , and new M5-powered MacBook Pro are all down to record low prices. Last-gen models are also cheaper than ever right now, with the Apple Watch Ultra 2 going for a healthy $200 off — a welcome discount if you’d rather not splurge for the newer, more expensive Watch Ultra 3 , which is a relatively iterative upgrade. There’s a whole lot more on sale, and to sift through discounts more easily, we’ve rounded them up by category. We’ve even sprinkled in some historical price info, so you can spot the best deals at a glance.

    "content_text": "The Aura Aspen is one of many gift-worthy items you can still pick up for Cyber Monday. If you’re hoping to whittle down your wish list before the holiday panic truly sets in, Cyber Monday presents a prime opportunity. Many of the tech-y gifts we recommend for Christmas, graduation, Mother’s Day, and other celebratory events throughout the year are receiving their steepest discounts to date. These aren’t random picks, either; they’re items we’ve tested, reviewed, or received as presents ourselves. The deals themselves span a wide range of categories and price points, making it easy to find something for everyone on your list. For instance, we’re currently seeing steep discounts on the latest AirPods Pro , Kindles , Nintendo Switch 2 controllers , and even a digital photo frame that looks surprisingly real. And while the majority of the picks here are gadgets, there are also Wes Anderson movies , cute kitchen utensils , and toolkits to consider. We’ve even included some basic necessities, because everyone deserves a clever charging cable . Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro The Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro combines a portable color-changing smart lamp with a Bluetooth speaker. Through the Govee app, you can customize its LEDs to sync with your music, or to display the light scene of your choice. It’ll let you set the mood for a party or for a night of studying. Where to Buy: $179.99 $134.99 at Amazon $179.99 $134.99 at Govee $179.99 $134.99 at Best Buy Aura Aspen Even if your loved ones lives halfway around the world, the Aura Aspen can help them feel close. The new 12-inch display looks more akin to a traditional photo frame than other models, in part due to an antiglare screen, slim bezels, and a 4:3 aspect ratio. It can also automatically showcase images via Google Photos, iCloud Photos, or a companion app, the latter of which even allows for text captions. Where to Buy: $229 $199.99 at Aura $229.99 $199.99 at Best Buy $229.99 $199.99 at Target GuliKit ES Pro controller Just because GuliKit’s ES Pro costs significantly less than  Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller doesn’t mean it’s cheaply made. It’s equipped with anti-drift TMR joysticks with adjustable sensitivity, an eight-direction D-pad, and the rare ability to wake the Switch 2. Not bad for a gamepad that retails for a third of the price. Where to Buy: $29.99 $23.69 at Amazon (black) $29.99 $23.69 at Amazon (white) Apple AirTag Whether they’re planning to take a vacation or just prone to losing things, an AirTag is a smart, stress-saving gift.

Where to Buy: $249 $219.99 at Amazon $249.99 $219.99 at Best Buy $249 $219.99 at Walmart Amazfit Active 2 It’s still hard believe the Amazfit Active 2 retails for less than $100. The humble smartwatch includes everything from offline navigation and voice commands to a strength training mode that can auto-detect sets, reps, and rest periods. It also features a vivid OLED display and a super stylish watchface — which isn’t something often associated with affordable fitness trackers. Where to Buy: $99.99 $79.99 at Amazon $99.99 $79.99 at Walmart $99.99 $79.99 at Amazfit The Wes Anderson Archive Wes Anderson’s directing style is so distinct that it’s spawned a series of books dedicated to its aesthetic. The Wes Anderson Archive collects all of his films from Bottle Rocket through The French Dispatch in a single box set. The 20-disc trove includes every film on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray, plus more than 25 hours of special features and 10 illustrated booklets containing essays and interviews.

All of the included components, from the needlenose pliers and claw hammer to the textured carrying case, showcase a handsome minimalist design that’s far more attractive than the usual white-label fare. It makes for an attractive starter kit, if nothing else. Where to Buy: $59.99 $38.49 at Amazon $59.99 $38.49 at Walmart Blink Video Doorbell (second-gen) The latest Blink Video Doorbell is a great pick for anyone who values peace of mind (or doesn’t want to get off the couch to answer the door).

The battery-powered buzzer can even be hardwired, extending its longevity.

Not us, which is why several folks at The Verge own Baseus’ handy, retractable USB-C option. The Free2Pull comes in two sizes, each of which conveniently pulls the excess cable into a small puck that’s far tidier and easier to manage than a loose cord.

It’ll launch first in Korea on December 12th, with a US launch planned for the first quarter of 2026. There’s no price just yet, but if <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/709990/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review\">a phone with one hinge costs $2,000</a>, you should probably start saving your <s>pennies</s> nickels for this one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The TriFold’s inner screen measures 10 inches on the diagonal, with a 2160 x 1584 resolution and a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that goes all the way down to 1Hz. That’s a lot of screen. You can run three apps vertically side by side on it, and even use Samsung’s DeX desktop environment in a standalone mode without a separate display. On paper, the TriFold’s outer screen looks a lot like the one on the Z Fold 7. It’s a 6.5-inch 1080p display with a 21:9 aspect ratio.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/002-Introducing-Galaxy-Z-TriFold-The-Shape-of-Whats-Next-in-Mobile-Innovation.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Each of the TriFold’s three panels has a slightly different thickness. The center panel is the thickest at 4.2mm, and it houses a USB-C port on the bottom edge. The thinnest panel measures just 3.9mm thick, including a physical SIM tray, and the other panel is 4.0mm thick. Those two sides fold inward over the center panel, unlike <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/huawei/667574/huawei-mate-xt-review-trifold-phone\">Huawei’s Mate XT</a>, which folds in a Z shape and uses part of the inner screen when folded. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The TriFold measures 12.9mm thick when it’s folded<strong> </strong>— 4.7mm thicker than a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It’s also thicker than a Z Fold 7, which is 8.9mm when you fold it, but it’s not far off the previous Z Fold 6 which is 12.1mm folded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although it folds differently, the Z TriFold is pretty close in size and weight to Huawei’s Mate XT and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/771122/huaweis-second-trifold-adds-stylus-support-and-purple-pleather\">most recent XTs</a>. The Z TriFold is just a little thicker when folded — 12.9mm versus 12.8mm — and weighs 309 grams compared to the 298g XT. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The back panel is a “ceramic-glass fiber-reinforced polymer” designed to resist cracking. The device’s hinges are two different sizes, both with a dual-rail design protected by a titanium housing. Like Samsung’s other foldables, the TriFold is rated IP48 — fully water resistant, but not dust-tight.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/z_trifold_3.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.4317548746518,100,89.136490250696\" title=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/z_trifold_7.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5555555555556,100,88.888888888889\" title=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/z_trifold_5.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5555555555556,100,88.888888888889\" title=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/z_trifold_6.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5555555555556,100,88.888888888889\" title=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/z_trifold_4.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5555555555556,100,88.888888888889\" title=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/z_trifold_2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5555555555556,100,88.888888888889\" title=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With all that going on inside the TriFold, Samsung has still managed to squeeze in three rear cameras: a 200-megapixel f/1.7 wide angle; a 12-megapixel ultrawide; and a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto. Both the cover screen and inner screen include a 10-megapixel selfie camera as well. Each of the phone’s panels houses a battery as well, adding up to a 5,600mAh capacity. The whole thing is powered by a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, like the S25 series, and includes 16GB of RAM.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing I’m <em>not</em> seeing on the TriFold’s spec sheet? S Pen compatibility. Samsung spokesperson Elise Sembach confirmed to <em>The Verge </em>over email that the TriFold lacks support for the company’s Bluetooth stylus. The Z Fold used to include stylus support, but that ended with the most recent Z Fold 7. In the meantime, Samsung isn’t sharing how much the TriFold will cost — either in Korea or in the US.</p>",

Each of the TriFold’s three panels has a slightly different thickness. The center panel is the thickest at 4.2mm, and it houses a USB-C port on the bottom edge. The thinnest panel measures just 3.9mm thick, including a physical SIM tray, and the other panel is 4.0mm thick. Those two sides fold inward over the center panel, unlike Huawei’s Mate XT , which folds in a Z shape and uses part of the inner screen when folded. The TriFold measures 12.9mm thick when it’s folded — 4.7mm thicker than a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It’s also thicker than a Z Fold 7, which is 8.9mm when you fold it, but it’s not far off the previous Z Fold 6 which is 12.1mm folded. Although it folds differently, the Z TriFold is pretty close in size and weight to Huawei’s Mate XT and most recent XTs . The Z TriFold is just a little thicker when folded — 12.9mm versus 12.8mm — and weighs 309 grams compared to the 298g XT. The back panel is a “ceramic-glass fiber-reinforced polymer” designed to resist cracking. The device’s hinges are two different sizes, both with a dual-rail design protected by a titanium housing. Like Samsung’s other foldables, the TriFold is rated IP48 — fully water resistant, but not dust-tight. With all that going on inside the TriFold, Samsung has still managed to squeeze in three rear cameras: a 200-megapixel f/1.7 wide angle; a 12-megapixel ultrawide; and a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto. Both the cover screen and inner screen include a 10-megapixel selfie camera as well. Each of the phone’s panels houses a battery as well, adding up to a 5,600mAh capacity. The whole thing is powered by a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, like the S25 series, and includes 16GB of RAM. One thing I’m not seeing on the TriFold’s spec sheet? S Pen compatibility. Samsung spokesperson Elise Sembach confirmed to The Verge over email that the TriFold lacks support for the company’s Bluetooth stylus. The Z Fold used to include stylus support, but that ended with the most recent Z Fold 7. In the meantime, Samsung isn’t sharing how much the TriFold will cost — either in Korea or in the US.",

You can still find low prices on excellent TVs, streaming devices, and soundbars through Cyber Monday. I’ve found the best of these deals to level up your home theater setup, and make sure that your holiday season (and every day after) is filled with the best picture and sound quality for your space.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cyber Monday usually offers great deals on products from last year, as retailers attempt to clear their inventory, but this year there’s also amazing pricing — more than I’ve seen in the past — on current models. And those prices are across all the major manufacturers, with deals on mini-LED (great for a bright room) or OLED and QD-OLED TVs, which deliver the best contrast you can get with a dynamic image. Atmos soundbars will send sounds zooming around your room, and streaming devices and disc players serve up your favorite content.

The S90F is also very accurate and has excellent color gamut coverage, which translates to vibrant, lifelike colors.

    "content_text": "Hisense’s S7N Canvas TV is an art-inspired TV that’s down to one of its best prices. Black Friday might have passed, but that doesn’t mean the holiday deals are gone. You can still find low prices on excellent TVs, streaming devices, and soundbars through Cyber Monday. I’ve found the best of these deals to level up your home theater setup, and make sure that your holiday season (and every day after) is filled with the best picture and sound quality for your space. Cyber Monday usually offers great deals on products from last year, as retailers attempt to clear their inventory, but this year there’s also amazing pricing — more than I’ve seen in the past — on current models. And those prices are across all the major manufacturers, with deals on mini-LED (great for a bright room) or OLED and QD-OLED TVs, which deliver the best contrast you can get with a dynamic image. Atmos soundbars will send sounds zooming around your room, and streaming devices and disc players serve up your favorite content. Take a look at what I’ve lined up for you. 4K TV deals TV source and streaming device deals Soundbar deals 4K TV deals Hisense U65QF TV (2025) While getting a high-end TV for $2,000 during Cyber Monday is great, not everyone wants to spend that much. The Hisense U6 might be an entry-level model, but it still offers great performance for the price — especially when that price is 50 percent off and under $400. Where to Buy: $799.99 $397.99 at Amazon (55-inch) $799.99 $399.99 at Best Buy (55-inch) $847.99 $547.99 at Amazon (65-inch) Sony Bravia 8 II Sony TVs don’t see the same level of discounts as competitors, so being able to save $1,000 or more on the winner of the Value Electronics “King of TV” 2025 shootout (where The Verge ’s own Nilay Patel was a judge) is a huge opportunity. It’s a fantastic OLED TV that’s sure to please. Where to Buy: $2999.99 $1998 at Amazon (55-inch) $2999.99 $1998 at B&H Photo (55-inch) $3499.99 $2299.99 at Amazon (65-inch) If you’re looking for a solid OLED TV, but don’t need the best of the best, the Samsung S90F is one of the best 65-inch TVs you can get for its sale price of $1,397.99 (down from about $1,600 last month) at Amazon and two dollars more at Best Buy . It might not be the brightest OLED of 2025 (for that, see the LG G5 ), but at a little over 1,400 nits, there’s plenty of light to combat a well-lit living space. The S90F is also very accurate and has excellent color gamut coverage, which translates to vibrant, lifelike colors. And for gamers, all four HDMI ports are version 2.1, the TV supports high refresh rates with FreeSync up to 144Hz for PC gaming, and its input lag is under 10ms. Hisense’s 65-inch S7N Canvas TV is the company’s answer to Samsung’s popular Frame TV, one you can currently grab for $847.99 ($452 off) at Amazon , which is about $48 shy of its best price to date. The 4K set features a matte screen that makes the artwork it displays more akin to a real painting, and Hisense includes a wall mount, allowing you to hang it. The S7N also has a QLED panel with a 144Hz refresh rate and four HDMI ports (two HDMI 2.1 and two HDMI 2.0), making it suitable for a mix of current and last-gen gaming consoles. Hisense U7 Series ULED TV (2025) It’s always more immersive to watch TV and movies on a bigger screen, but up until the last few years that required a projector. Now, TVs like the 100-inch Hisense U7 deliver a brighter image than any projector ever could for a fraction of the cost. Where to Buy: $3497.99 $2199.99 at Best Buy (100-inch) Roku Pro Series 4K TV Roku’s latest Pro 4K TV has a 120Hz refresh rate, four HDMI ports (two of which are 2.1), full-array local dimming for even brightness, and support for both Dolby Vision IQ and HDR 10 Plus for better color accuracy. It also works with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home, making it easy to integrate into most smart homes. Where to Buy: $899.99 $597.99 at Amazon (55-inch) $1199.99 $797.99 at Amazon (65-inch) $1199.99 $798.99 at Best Buy (65-inch) LG’s 55-inch C5 OLED is down to around $1,196.99 ($803 off) at Amazon , B&H Photo , and LG’s online storefront , which remains one of its better prices to date. The midrange 4K TV is a good entry point into the world of OLED technology, offering a solid balance of design, brightness, and high-end gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 144Hz with variable refresh rate tech. The C5 also handles glare and ambient light better than the step-down B5; however, OLED panels are still not ideal for really bright rooms. TV source and streaming device deals Google TV Streamer (4K) Google’s terrific TV Streamer (4K) is the company’s best attempt at a streaming device yet, with built-in ethernet, an excellent interface, and smart home compatibility with both Matter and Thread.
