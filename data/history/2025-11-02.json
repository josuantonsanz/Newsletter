The video offers a quick glimpse at a pretty standard-looking rectangle. There are dual cameras in the top-left corner, and you can make out what appear to be shoulder buttons. Android Central has suggested that the Ayaneo phone could have a sliding design similar to the Sony Xperia Play , where the controls are hidden beneath the screen, but it’s impossible to tell from the video. Ayaneo wouldn’t be the only company on the market with a gaming-focused phone, but modern versions typically eschew physical controls. They tend to be phones first and foremost, but with high-end chips and cooling to help them handle demanding games. Physical controls are usually reserved for accessories, but maybe the Ayaneo phone will buck that trend. Of course, we don’t even know if the Ayaneo phone will be coming to the US or not, so don’t get too excited just yet.",
