Similar to Apple’s Find My app, it allows authorized members of a “Circle” to see each other’s real-time locations in the app. Each member has control over whether the app shares their location, as well as how precise a view of their location other members have at any time. The service can send alerts to members of your circle when you arrive somewhere, leave somewhere, and when your flight lands. It essentially does away with all those “text me when you get there” requests from parents and family members.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Life360 offers more than just location services.

Tesla has never publicly demonstrated that its vehicles can operate fully driverless, without a human safety driver behind the wheel, on public roads. We have seen them drive themselves within the confines of Tesla’s factory, which is an environment totally controlled by the company and nowhere near as complex as an active city street with pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25670862/Robotaxi_89.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We know that Tesla plans to launch the service with 10–20 Model Y vehicles. Are these vehicles meaningfully different from the Model Ys that Tesla sells to its customers? It seems very likely, given that Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot and AI software, said in a recent earnings call that they would have “audio inputs” so they can pick up sirens from emergency vehicles, for example.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These vehicles will also be heavily teleoperated, meaning there will be remote operators watching the vehicles through their embedded cameras, ready to take control should a problem arise. But keep in mind this came from a research note published by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, not from Tesla itself. Jonas also said the service will be invite-only at launch. So unless you’re a Tesla investor, a social media influencer with a sizable following, or a close personal friend of Elon Musk’s, don’t make any immediate plans to travel to Austin next month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tesla’s approach to its self-driving service is a major departure from how robotaxi companies typically handle these types of launches. Waymo, which it should be noted operates the only publicly available robotaxi service in the US, tests its driverless vehicles for weeks, sometimes months, before opening them up to members of the public.

Sometimes it uses that information to launch a commercial robotaxi service; other times that data is just fed into Waymo’s central computer to make general improvements to its automated driving software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Waymo is also relatively transparent about its process. Before it launched a robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, the company invited journalists from dozens of outlets to its testing facility in Castle, California, allowing them to ride in the vehicles on a closed course.

Even the federal government, of which Musk was most recently a quasi-member as part of DOGE, has a lot of questions about the imminent launch.

As expected, the initial rollout process at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers on April 24th <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems\">was an absolute mess</a> — and GameStop <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/655626/nintendo-switch-2-gamestop-preorder\">didn’t fare much better</a> later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of right now, none of the aforementioned retailers are accepting reservations for the $449 gaming console ahead of its release on June 5th. Nintendo is still <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/\">accepting sign-ups</a> for those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements\">there are strict requirements</a>. Nintendo also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/655159/my-nintendo-store-switch-2-invites\">can’t guarantee an invite</a> ahead of launch due to “the very high demand” for the console. Surprising, I know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don’t know when the next Switch 2 preorders will open up, but since we’re close to the official launch date, it might just be time to make preparations to try for a console on June 5th. If you’re trying to secure a Switch 2 on launch day, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/665958/nintendo-switch-2-best-buy-stock-launch-day\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://corporate.target.com/news-features/article/2025/05/nintendo-switch-2\">Target</a><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/665958/nintendo-switch-2-best-buy-stock-launch-day\">,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/668918/gamestop-nintendo-switch-2-stock-in-store-online-launch\">GameStop</a> have confirmed that they will have limited inventory for purchase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the meantime, we suggest keeping an eye on the retailers below and taking a few steps to ensure you’re set up for success in the event that surprise preorders re-open ahead of the console’s release.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#retailer-landing-pages\">Retailer landing pages</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#what-switch-2-configurations-are-available\">What Switch 2 configurations are available?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#a-few-essentials-tips-to-keep-in-mind\">A few essentials tips to keep in mind</a><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#create-accounts-for-every-retailer\">Create accounts for every retailer</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#download-the-mobile-apps\">Download the mobile apps</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#sign-up-for-retailer-notifications\">Sign up for retailer notifications</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#buying-online-skip-the-accessories\">Buying online?

Nintendo is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641933/switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-limited-time-production\">on record saying</a> the bundle will only be available through fall 2025 (or while supplies last), which is a shame, considering picking up the console / game combo saves you $30 on what is easily the Switch 2’s biggest launch title. If you don’t manage to secure the bundle, you’ll have to pick up <em>Mario Kart World</em> separately <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mario-Kart-World-U-S-Version/15940407280\">for a whopping $79</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also worth noting that prices could change down the line. Nintendo <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date\">recently raised the price</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button\">Switch 2 Joy-Cons</a> and the  <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details\">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> in response to tariffs, and has said that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.” The starting price of the Nintendo Switch 2 remains unchanged, but at this point, it feels like the only way to guarantee a console at $449.99 is to purchase one at launch.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"a-few-essentials-tips-to-keep-in-mind\">A few essentials tips to keep in mind</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the initial preorder launch of the Switch 2 is any indication, retailers are woefully under-equipped to handle the massive influx of interest in preorders. Inventory for the Switch 2 seems to be limited despite the fact Nintendo supposedly had time to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/645534/nintendo-switch-2-supply-demand-inventory-us-tariffs-doug-bowser\">build up an inventory</a> of the next-gen system “on a global basis.” That being the case, we suggest taking a few steps to set yourself up for success in the event preorders do drop again between now and launch day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ll continue to do our best to let you know which retailers have inventory as we approach June 5th, but for now, we’ve rounded up a few helpful tips that should help you improve your chances.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-accounts-for-every-retailer\">Create accounts for every retailer</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First things first: create accounts at Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and other retailers if you haven’t done so already. Both Best Buy and Walmart implemented a queue system when taking Switch 2 preorders in an effort to deter scalpers — a tactic also employed during the rollout of the PlayStation 5. That’s why it’s in your best interest to ensure your account is set up with the appropriate credentials. Confirm your location and delivery info, get your payment details in order, and log in to your account prior to making your purchase.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8230; most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Setting up and verifying this information in advance will help streamline the checkout process, thus allowing you to save precious seconds. This is crucial, given most retailers won’t hold your console while checking out.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"download-the-mobile-apps\">Download the mobile apps</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you own a smartphone, we recommend downloading — and logging into — the respective retailer apps for Walmart, Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. In the past, we’ve found that the dedicated mobile apps for various retailers are faster than using a traditional browser; they also provide an additional means of procuring a console, thus increasing your chances of securing a Switch 2 at launch.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sign-up-for-retailer-notifications\">Sign up for retailer notifications</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A couple of retailers, specifically <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/video-games/nintendo/pcmcat1742407305710.c\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/nintendo-switch/consoles/products/nintendo-switch-2/424543.html\">GameStop</a>, allow you to sign up for updates regarding Nintendo Switch 2 availability, including for the console’s games and accessories. So far, neither retailer has divulged much beyond what is available on their retail sites; however, they serve as yet another opportunity to stay informed regarding how each retailer plans to handle the Switch 2 rollout going forward.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Nintendo-Switch-2-Lifestyle-Image-5.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=6.6,21.305020390944,76.8,60.315078548757\" title=\"\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buying-online-skip-the-accessories\">Buying online? Skip the accessories</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nintendo will have a raft of new accessories available for the Switch 2 at launch, including a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details\">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>, carrying cases, and even a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250423214048/https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch\">camera accessory for video chats</a>. And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo’s first-party peripherals takes time that’s better spent on securing a console. Plus, accessory preorders don’t typically sell out nearly as fast as consoles, meaning you can always circle back for extras at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers once you’ve managed to reserve your Switch 2.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"try-your-local-brick-and-mortar-store\">Try your local brick-and-mortar store</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This might come as a surprise, but preorders aren’t only available online. A handful of retailers, including Best Buy and GameStop, opened in-store preorders for the Switch 2 following their online release. Each store has only been allocated a handful of launch units — the <a href=\"http://had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles\">GameStop location our own Ash Parrish visited</a>&nbsp;had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles — so it can’t hurt to ask the folks at the store nearest you if they’re still accepting preorders. The chances are slim, sure, but who knows? You might get lucky.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"follow-us-and-others\">Follow us (and others)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As you might expect, we’ll be closely monitoring Switch 2 inventory in the coming week or two — or longer if it remains unavailable following its release on June 5th.

We anticipate that Amazon will sell the console at some point, but based on previous console launches, the rollout at Amazon is likely to be sporadic and unpredictable. Either way, we’ll update this post accordingly if Amazon — or any other retailer — begins offering preorders or announces in-store availability on launch day.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"my-nintendo-store\">My Nintendo Store</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unsurprisingly, one of the few confirmed retailers accepting reservations is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/\">My Nintendo Store</a>, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and select the console configuration you prefer, along with any desired accessories. Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Currently, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years of age. Invitations are valid for 72 hours and “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to&nbsp;<em>share</em>&nbsp;gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250415162056/https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy\">in the privacy section</a>&nbsp;when logged into your account).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account …</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria — a process Nintendo says is currently ongoing — invitations will be sent to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. The invitations are nontransferable and sent to the email address you provided while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases are also limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, which began with the first batch of invitations on May 8th.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additional invitations are to follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that. However, in <a href=\"http://Nintendo says that due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.”\">a recent update to its site</a>, Nintendo specified that, due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"walmart\">Walmart</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walmart isn’t currently accepting preorders for the <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-System/15949610846/\">standalone Switch 2</a> ($449) or the <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle/15928868255/\"><em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle</a> ($499), though you can still preorder games like <em><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-U-S-Version/15949810208/\">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> ($69) and accessories like the <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Joy-Con-2-Wheel-set-of-2/15940757432/\">Joy-Con Wheel Set</a> ($24.88). That being said, Walmart’s website&nbsp;still indicates that, if you do manage to preorder a console before 8AM ET on June 4th, you should receive it before 9AM ET on June 5th.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"gamestop\">GameStop</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">GameStop is no longer accepting preorders for the <a href=\"https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/nintendo-switch/consoles/products/nintendo-switch-2/424543.html\">standalone console</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/nintendo-switch-2/products/nintendo-switch-2-console-and-mario-kart-world-bundle/424542.html\"><em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a>. If you’re looking to bring the cost down in the future, though, it offers up to $175 off a Switch 2 when you trade in a Switch OLED, or up to $125 off when you trade in a regular Switch. In both instances, you’ll need everything that came with your console — specifically the Switch, its dock, two working Joy-Con controllers (with wrist straps), an HDMI cable, and a power cord. GameStop also <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/switch-2-buyers-hold-on-to-your-original-switch-the-resale-is-not-worth-it-2000592660\">confirmed to <em>Gizmodo</em></a> that the exact valuation will depend on the condition of your console, including whether your Joy-Cons are experiencing the dreaded stick drift.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re still looking to pick up a Switch 2 at launch, <a href=\"https://x.com/gamestop/status/1923484007754498056\">GameStop will have additional units</a> available both in-store and online. The retailer’s in-store launch event kicks off at 3PM local time on June 4th, with pickups starting on June 5th at 12AM EST / June 4th at 9PM PST. Online orders will also begin on June 5th at 12AM EST/ June 4th at 9PM PST, though, in both instances, inventory will be limited.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-buy\">Best Buy</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Best Buy isn’t accepting online preorders for the <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-2-system-multi/6614313.p\">standalone console</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-multi/6614325.p\"><em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle</a> right now, but if you do manage to reserve a console through Best Buy, the retailer has announced that most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup. Furthermore, if you missed the initial preorder window, “most stores will have limited inventory of systems, games, and accessories for in-store purchase” when they open at 12:01AM ET on June 5th, at least <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo%2Fpcmcat1742407305710.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1742407305710&amp;subId2=[vg0522awD][665958][][][][][][][][][]\">according to the retailer’s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, if you’re a My Best Buy Plus or Total member, you can currently score $20 in credit for every $150 you spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear (<a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/clp-video-games/nintendo-member-offer/pcmcat1742915358934.c?id=pcmcat1742915358934\">excluding all Switch and Switch 2 hardware</a>). That privilege will <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/best-buy-membership/pcmcat1679668833285.c\">run you at least $49.99 a year</a>, though both membership tiers also grant you access to a number of exclusive perks, including limited-time discounts and free two-day shipping.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"target\">Target</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Target has sold out of its initial preorder stock for both the <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-console/-/A-94693225#lnk=sametab\">standalone Switch 2</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-console-mario-kart-world-bundle/-/A-94693226#lnk=sametab\"><em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a>, along with many accessories.

    "content_text": "Following a brief delay stemming from the Trump administration’s on-again, off-again tariff policy, Nintendo officially opened up preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2. As expected, the initial rollout process at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers on April 24th was an absolute mess — and GameStop didn’t fare much better later. As of right now, none of the aforementioned retailers are accepting reservations for the $449 gaming console ahead of its release on June 5th. Nintendo is still accepting sign-ups for those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware that there are strict requirements . Nintendo also can’t guarantee an invite ahead of launch due to “the very high demand” for the console. Surprising, I know. We don’t know when the next Switch 2 preorders will open up, but since we’re close to the official launch date, it might just be time to make preparations to try for a console on June 5th. If you’re trying to secure a Switch 2 on launch day, Best Buy , Target , and GameStop have confirmed that they will have limited inventory for purchase. In the meantime, we suggest keeping an eye on the retailers below and taking a few steps to ensure you’re set up for success in the event that surprise preorders re-open ahead of the console’s release. Retailer landing pages What Switch 2 configurations are available? A few essentials tips to keep in mind Create accounts for every retailer Download the mobile apps Sign up for retailer notifications Buying online? Skip the accessories Try your local brick-and-mortar store Follow us (and others) Where can I get a Switch 2? My Nintendo Store Walmart GameStop Best Buy Target Newegg, Sam’s Club, and Antonline Retailer landing pages What Switch 2 configurations are available? At launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be available in two distinct configurations: a $449.99 standard version and a $499.99 bundle that includes the latest Mario Kart title, Mario Kart World . Nintendo is on record saying the bundle will only be available through fall 2025 (or while supplies last), which is a shame, considering picking up the console / game combo saves you $30 on what is easily the Switch 2’s biggest launch title. If you don’t manage to secure the bundle, you’ll have to pick up Mario Kart World separately for a whopping $79 . It’s also worth noting that prices could change down the line. Nintendo recently raised the price of the Switch 2 Joy-Cons and the Switch 2 Pro Controller in response to tariffs, and has said that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.” The starting price of the Nintendo Switch 2 remains unchanged, but at this point, it feels like the only way to guarantee a console at $449.99 is to purchase one at launch. A few essentials tips to keep in mind If the initial preorder launch of the Switch 2 is any indication, retailers are woefully under-equipped to handle the massive influx of interest in preorders. Inventory for the Switch 2 seems to be limited despite the fact Nintendo supposedly had time to build up an inventory of the next-gen system “on a global basis.” That being the case, we suggest taking a few steps to set yourself up for success in the event preorders do drop again between now and launch day. We’ll continue to do our best to let you know which retailers have inventory as we approach June 5th, but for now, we’ve rounded up a few helpful tips that should help you improve your chances. Create accounts for every retailer First things first: create accounts at Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and other retailers if you haven’t done so already. Both Best Buy and Walmart implemented a queue system when taking Switch 2 preorders in an effort to deter scalpers — a tactic also employed during the rollout of the PlayStation 5. That’s why it’s in your best interest to ensure your account is set up with the appropriate credentials. Confirm your location and delivery info, get your payment details in order, and log in to your account prior to making your purchase. … most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line Setting up and verifying this information in advance will help streamline the checkout process, thus allowing you to save precious seconds. This is crucial, given most retailers won’t hold your console while checking out. Download the mobile apps If you own a smartphone, we recommend downloading — and logging into — the respective retailer apps for Walmart, Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. In the past, we’ve found that the dedicated mobile apps for various retailers are faster than using a traditional browser; they also provide an additional means of procuring a console, thus increasing your chances of securing a Switch 2 at launch. Sign up for retailer notifications A couple of retailers, specifically Best Buy and GameStop , allow you to sign up for updates regarding Nintendo Switch 2 availability, including for the console’s games and accessories. So far, neither retailer has divulged much beyond what is available on their retail sites; however, they serve as yet another opportunity to stay informed regarding how each retailer plans to handle the Switch 2 rollout going forward. Buying online? Skip the accessories Nintendo will have a raft of new accessories available for the Switch 2 at launch, including a Switch 2 Pro Controller , carrying cases, and even a camera accessory for video chats . And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo’s first-party peripherals takes time that’s better spent on securing a console. Plus, accessory preorders don’t typically sell out nearly as fast as consoles, meaning you can always circle back for extras at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers once you’ve managed to reserve your Switch 2. Try your local brick-and-mortar store This might come as a surprise, but preorders aren’t only available online. A handful of retailers, including Best Buy and GameStop, opened in-store preorders for the Switch 2 following their online release. Each store has only been allocated a handful of launch units — the GameStop location our own Ash Parrish visited had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles — so it can’t hurt to ask the folks at the store nearest you if they’re still accepting preorders. The chances are slim, sure, but who knows? You might get lucky. Follow us (and others) As you might expect, we’ll be closely monitoring Switch 2 inventory in the coming week or two — or longer if it remains unavailable following its release on June 5th. Bookmark our main deals hub , and if you haven’t already, subscribe to our Verge Deals newsletter ! We’ll be sending special alerts as the console become available; it’s also a great way to stay in the know regarding the latest deals and discounts, all of which come from one of our very own Verge staffers. Where can I get a Switch 2? Right now, the only confirmed retailers for the Nintendo Switch 2 are Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, Target, Staples, Newegg, Sam’s Club, and Antonline. We anticipate that Amazon will sell the console at some point, but based on previous console launches, the rollout at Amazon is likely to be sporadic and unpredictable. Either way, we’ll update this post accordingly if Amazon — or any other retailer — begins offering preorders or announces in-store availability on launch day. My Nintendo Store Unsurprisingly, one of the few confirmed retailers accepting reservations is the My Nintendo Store , which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and select the console configuration you prefer, along with any desired accessories. Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions. Currently, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years of age. Invitations are valid for 72 hours and “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to share gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so in the privacy section when logged into your account). Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account … Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria — a process Nintendo says is currently ongoing — invitations will be sent to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. The invitations are nontransferable and sent to the email address you provided while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases are also limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, which began with the first batch of invitations on May 8th. Additional invitations are to follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that. However, in a recent update to its site , Nintendo specified that, due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.” Walmart Walmart isn’t currently accepting preorders for the standalone Switch 2 ($449) or the Mario Kart World bundle ($499), though you can still preorder games like Donkey Kong Bananza ($69) and accessories like the Joy-Con Wheel Set ($24.88). That being said, Walmart’s website still indicates that, if you do manage to preorder a console before 8AM ET on June 4th, you should receive it before 9AM ET on June 5th. GameStop GameStop is no longer accepting preorders for the standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle . If you’re looking to bring the cost down in the future, though, it offers up to $175 off a Switch 2 when you trade in a Switch OLED, or up to $125 off when you trade in a regular Switch. In both instances, you’ll need everything that came with your console — specifically the Switch, its dock, two working Joy-Con controllers (with wrist straps), an HDMI cable, and a power cord. GameStop also confirmed to Gizmodo that the exact valuation will depend on the condition of your console, including whether your Joy-Cons are experiencing the dreaded stick drift. If you’re still looking to pick up a Switch 2 at launch, GameStop will have additional units available both in-store and online. The retailer’s in-store launch event kicks off at 3PM local time on June 4th, with pickups starting on June 5th at 12AM EST / June 4th at 9PM PST. Online orders will also begin on June 5th at 12AM EST/ June 4th at 9PM PST, though, in both instances, inventory will be limited. Best Buy Best Buy isn’t accepting online preorders for the standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle right now, but if you do manage to reserve a console through Best Buy, the retailer has announced that most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup. Furthermore, if you missed the initial preorder window, “most stores will have limited inventory of systems, games, and accessories for in-store purchase” when they open at 12:01AM ET on June 5th, at least according to the retailer’s website . Additionally, if you’re a My Best Buy Plus or Total member, you can currently score $20 in credit for every $150 you spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear ( excluding all Switch and Switch 2 hardware ). That privilege will run you at least $49.99 a year , though both membership tiers also grant you access to a number of exclusive perks, including limited-time discounts and free two-day shipping. Target Target has sold out of its initial preorder stock for both the standalone Switch 2 and the Mario Kart World bundle , along with many accessories. Some games, including Mario Kart World ($79.99) and the Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ($69.99), are still available. The company shared that it will have both configurations of the console in-store on launch day, June 5th, and that it’ll open online orders the following day. Consoles will be limited to one per guest. If you’re heading to a store, you can begin lining up at a “designated queuing location” at your local Target store’s entrance. Tickets will be handed out, and if you get one, you’re guaranteed a product to purchase. Newegg, Sam’s Club, and Antonline As far as we know, Newegg, Sam’s Club, and Antonline never opened preorders on April 24th. However, Newegg has published a landing page for both the standalone console and the Mario Kart World bundle , indicating it will have Switch 2 stock at some point. The same applies to Antonline and Sam’s Club , though you will need a Club membership ($50 a year) to take advantage of the latter retailer. That said, the mere fact the wholesaler requires you to sign up for a premium subscription to shop might also increase your odds of securing at launch. Update, May 29th : Updated to add Staples as a retailer that will have Switch 2 stock. Also, we added information on Target’s launch day plans.",
