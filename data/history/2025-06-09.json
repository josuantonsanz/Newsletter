The best part of all these Windows changes is that you won’t necessarily need a new device to benefit from them. “The Xbox full-screen experience will first come to the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X, and our next focus will be updating the in-market ROG Ally and the ROG Ally X,” says Sones. “Similar full-screen Xbox experiences will be rolling out to other Windows handhelds, starting next year.” Valve is also supporting SteamOS on the ROG Ally , so we should be able to compare Valve and Microsoft’s handheld operating systems on the same hardware soon. We don’t yet know if Microsoft has done enough to stop other PC makers from being tempted over to SteamOS like Lenovo has , but Microsoft’s efforts are really setting up a battle between Windows and Linux for the future of handheld gaming PCs.",

We’re looking forward to taking some time for ourselves by hiking, biking, or hanging out and listening to our favorite tunes, maybe accompanied by some soft-serve ice cream to cool things down. We’ve asked our staff about the gadgets they plan to use this summer to help get away and have fun. Here’s what some of them recommend.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s nothing that brings a smile to my family’s faces faster than soft-serve ice cream. It&#8217;s definitely something we bond over, although usually it’s when we’re on the way back from the beach or as an after-dinner treat while on vacation. So, when I got a chance to try the new Ninja Swirl Creami at home, I jumped on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An ice-cream maker and soft-serve dispenser in one, the Ninja makes ice cream on one side and then dollops it out in soft-serve form on the other. Unlike my previous attempts at making homemade frozen treats from scratch with my <a href=\"https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/attachments/p.ice-cream-maker-attachment.ksmicm.html\">KitchenAid stand mixer</a>, the Ninja makes this super easy to do. (You still need to be patient as it has to freeze for 24 hours.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the real bonus — and what made this a big hit in my house — is that you can stick store-bought ice cream into it and turn it into soft-serve in seconds; no waiting required, just endless sundae bowls and swirl cones on tap for summer hangouts. The only downside (other than price) is that we only got two decent-sized soft-serve cones out of each 16-oz pint container. Luckily, it comes with two containers, which helped keep the ice cream flowing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve also enjoyed creating unusual frozen delights in the Ninja. Inspired by a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/\">very active Reddit forum</a>, we tried frozen tomato soup (really yummy), fresh watermelon mixed with condensed milk (ah-ma-zing), and my son’s morning protein smoothies in frozen form — the perfect way to prep him for a day of lifeguarding at the local pool. – <em>Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, smart home reviewer</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a pasty redhead from a large ginger family, I relish every opportunity to nag about the importance of wearing sunscreen — especially when the summer heat is pounding and everyone starts getting their fleshy bits out. If you’re someone who avoids applying the stuff because it makes your hands feel gross, then allow me to remove that excuse for you: sunscreen applicators are a convenient and mess-free solution that can help you protect your skin without itching to wipe your greasy hands on clothes or sandy towels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They’re great for applying sunscreen to your kids, too. The Solar Buddies version I use has a big handle, spongy applicator, and a roller dispenser that ensures even small hands have a good grip and don’t look like they’ve dunked themselves in frosting. You just have to fill them with your sunscreen of choice, giving some added flexibility around the brand and SPF (but please, <em>please</em> consider sticking with a factor of 50 plus).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because the applicator screws tightly closed, it can also help prevent any explosions from occurring in your bag compared to the usual squeeze bottles. Nobody likes a sunscreen sandwich. <em>— Jess Weatherbed, news writer</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re itching to get out on a bike ride even when it’s 85-plus degrees, you don’t want to be stuck without an adequate supply of water. I only have room for one drink holder on my bike, so I’ve found that it’s just far more convenient to carry water on my back with the aptly named CamelBak Hydrobak hydration pack. It’s a lightweight backpack that holds up to 1.5 liters of water, which it says is enough for a two-hour bike ride.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The backpack also comes with a handy straw that you just lift up and drink from, preventing you from having to stop and drink from your water bottle (unless you’re coordinated enough to take a sip while riding, which I am not). It also keeps your water relatively cool even when the sun is beating down your back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Aside from storing water, there’s a zipper pocket where you can store car keys, your ID, and other small items. It’s not just ideal for biking, either. Many people use the CamelBak Hydrobak on long hikes, runs, and even for music festivals.<em> — Emma Roth, news writer</em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I try to bring a Bluetooth speaker everywhere with me when the weather&#8217;s good. A pool party, a park day, a golf outing, a hang on the back patio — it&#8217;s all better with music! There are obviously lots of good speakers out there, but for me the UE Wonderboom 4 is the perfect one. It&#8217;s only $100, it&#8217;s small but loud enough to work just about anywhere, its battery lasts all day and then some, it&#8217;s waterproof, and it floats. (All the colors look nice, by the way, but… get the blue one.) There are fancier speakers with more features, and the $200 <a href=\"https://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/shop/p/megaboom-4.984-001964\">Megaboom</a> does sound a lot better, but I keep a Wonderboom in my trunk, and it has made me the party hero more times than I can count. <em>— David Pierce, editor-at-large</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The summer months mean more family walks, hikes, and time outdoors, and one of my favorite ways of exercising in the process is <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/rucking-the-ultimate-guide-to-this-exercise-trend\">rucking</a>. You don’t need a fancy GoRuck to go rucking; just throw as much weight as you want to carry into <em>any </em>sturdy backpack that feels good on you. But, while the Ruckers may be a little over-the-top on their “tacticool” looks for some folks, they are incredibly well made and nicely designed for weighted walks or even crossfit-style workouts. <em>— Antonio G. Di Benedetto, reviewer</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ever since I got scolded at urgent care (turns out the mysterious shooting pain in the back of my head was due to dehydration), this 40-oz flask has rarely left my side. It was a gift from a friend who works outside under the Los Angeles sun all year long, so trust her experience. This hefty bottle fits perfectly into my life — although not in any of the gym equipment cup holders, due to its generous girth (holder-friendly shapes are also available). I am to consume roughly two of these bottles’ worth of water daily, particularly when it gets hot in the summertime. Aside from being a sturdy receptacle, it really <em>is</em> a thermos, so it keeps my water cold for hours. <em>— Marina Galperina, senior tech editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For years, a close friend and I would go birding together, and one of our favorite late spring treks was to <a href=\"https://www.hawkmountain.org/\">Hawk Mountain in Pennsylvania</a> to observe the yearly raptor migration. Unfortunately, my friend never had strong ankles, and as the years passed, the trek up and down the mountain became more difficult. After she had one bad slip, I went to a local REI store and bought her a lightweight walking pole. She loved it. It came with a rubber tip for flat surfaces like sidewalks and a pointed tip for muddy or rocky terrain. It was lightweight and adjustable, and it had a comfortable grip. It could be quickly compressed and stored in her bag or the trunk of her car, and then expanded and used for hiking or just strolling. It was, she once told me, the most useful birthday gift I ever gave her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The walking pole I bought her is no longer available, but Leki’s <a href=\"https://lekiusa.com/products/legend-black-carbon?variant=46106174062886\">Legend Black Carbon one</a> is pretty close.&nbsp; <em>— Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I never thought I&#8217;d marvel at the design and engineering of a blanket until I tried this one from Matador. Made from a waterproof and surprisingly durable fabric given how thin it is, the Pocket Blanket is large enough to accommodate up to four adults when unfurled but folds up into its own built-in storage bag that&#8217;s about the size of a deck of cards. Refolding the Pocket Blanket is easy, thanks to a subtle printed pattern showing where all the fold lines should be, and it can be secured to the ground using either built-in metal corner stakes or small pockets that can be filled and weighed down with sand. We rarely leave the house without at least one slipped into a bag, and keep extras in the glove boxes of our cars.<em> — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My biggest deterrent to spending some time outside are bugs, mosquitos specifically. I wish they&#8217;d bug off. They have me looking like I&#8217;m doing interpretive dancing to avoid being poked. Thankfully, a gadget that I got last year has made it so that I don&#8217;t need to be (as) protective of my exposed skin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thermacell makes rechargeable and refillable mosquito repellers. I got the E-Series model, which creates a safe zone where you likely won&#8217;t be bitten. It lasts a little over five hours per charge, meaning I get more than one use out of it before needing to charge it again. Just be sure not to use it in an environment where there isn&#8217;t proper ventilation; Thermacell notes that its ingredients shouldn&#8217;t be a concern for people or pets, but I don&#8217;t want too much insecticide around my loved ones — or my food. <em>— Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>",
