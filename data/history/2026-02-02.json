It can shoot in 8K at 30 frames per second or in 5.7K at 60 frames per second. It comes with a remote control, and you can get a cockpit view with the included Vision Goggles. They provide a 360-degree first-person view even as the drone flies straight, letting you see things you might have otherwise missed. There’s a screen on the outside of the goggles that lets people see what you’re seeing through the A1’s eyes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This sale coincides with the launch of a new Flight Simulator feature that Antigravity launched on January 29th. It lets you practice flights via the Vision Goggles without actually having to fly the A1 drone. The company says that the feature creates a virtual flying environment that replicates how the A1 handles, helping those concerned about crashing become more comfortable with the controls.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"> If you’re looking for more information about the A1, check out Sean Hollister’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/837922/antigravity-360-us-release-price-best-buy\">in-depth hands-on</a>, and get a quick lowdown on what it’s all about with his TikTok video:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7538428961534070071\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@verge?refer=embed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@verge\">@verge</a> <p>I tried Antigravity, the first drone from Insta360.

    "content_text": "Antigravity’s ambitious A1 360-degree drone is 15 percent off through February 9th. The first-ever discount on this model is available across all bundles, with the most affordable option dropping from $1,599 to $1,359 at Amazon and Best Buy . Pricier bundles are also discounted and include accessories such as a carrying case, additional replaceable drone wings, and extra batteries. Antigravity A1 drone Where to Buy: $1599 $1359 at Amazon (Standard) $1599 $1359 at Best Buy (Standard) $1899 $1609 at Amazon (Explorer) The Antigravity A1, Insta360’s first drone, really impressed us during our hands-on with a prototype in December 2025. It can shoot in 8K at 30 frames per second or in 5.7K at 60 frames per second. It comes with a remote control, and you can get a cockpit view with the included Vision Goggles. They provide a 360-degree first-person view even as the drone flies straight, letting you see things you might have otherwise missed. There’s a screen on the outside of the goggles that lets people see what you’re seeing through the A1’s eyes. This sale coincides with the launch of a new Flight Simulator feature that Antigravity launched on January 29th. It lets you practice flights via the Vision Goggles without actually having to fly the A1 drone. The company says that the feature creates a virtual flying environment that replicates how the A1 handles, helping those concerned about crashing become more comfortable with the controls. If you’re looking for more information about the A1, check out Sean Hollister’s in-depth hands-on , and get a quick lowdown on what it’s all about with his TikTok video: @verge I tried Antigravity, the first drone from Insta360.
