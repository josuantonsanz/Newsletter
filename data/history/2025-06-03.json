Both the new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236804/airpods-max-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date\">AirPods Max</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/23313529/apple-airpods-4-noise-cancellation-price-features\">AirPods 4</a> (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review\">latest AirPods Pro with USB-C</a>. The same goes for the original AirPods Max, which are nearly indistinguishable from the last-gen model aside from the switch to a USB-C connector and a few new color options.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#yCNINu\">The best AirPods 4 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#Iewbkw\">The best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#x5NHYH\">The best AirPods Max deals</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"yCNINu\">The best AirPods 4 deals</h2>\n\n<p>At its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239739/apple-iphone-16-event-announcements-watch-series-10-airpods\">September event</a>, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.</p>\n\n<p>The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Although they launched at the end of last year, we’ve consistently been seeing discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are on sale for $119 ($10 off) —<strong> </strong>about $20 shy of their all-time low — at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-4/11381374703/\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.staples.com/apple-airpods-4-wireless-ambient-sound-earbuds-with-usb-c-charging-case-4th-generation-bluetooth-white-mxp63ll-a/product_24616046\">Staples</a>. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, meanwhile, are on sale at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-4-with-Active-Noise-Cancellation/11384707978/\">Walmart</a> for $158.59 ($19 off), which is $10 shy of their best price to date. If you prefer a different retailer, you can also buy them for around $169 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.staples.com/apple-airpods-noise-canceling-earbuds-with-usb-c-charging-case-4th-generation-bluetooth-white-mxp93ll-a/product_24616047\">Staples</a>.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"qd82sU\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review\">Read our full AirPods 4 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Iewbkw\">The best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals</h2>\n\n<p>In 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed up a year later with a minor refresh, one that features a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review\">USB-C charging case</a> and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price\">Apple’s new Vision Pro headset</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242929/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aids-fda-authorization\">doubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As far as deals go, Apple’s updated AirPods Pro with USB-C are currently available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C/5689919121\">Walmart</a> for $199 ($50 off), which is their typical sale price and a far cry from their all-time low of $153.99.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"YoBmJr\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review\">Read our AirPods Pro with USB-C impressions</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"x5NHYH\">The best AirPods Max deals</h2>\n\n<p>The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions.

    "content_text": "﻿Apple’s noise-canceling AirPods 4 are down to just $158.69 right now, which is one of their better prices to date. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the new AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the latest AirPods Pro with USB-C . The same goes for the original AirPods Max, which are nearly indistinguishable from the last-gen model aside from the switch to a USB-C connector and a few new color options. The best AirPods 4 deals The best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals The best AirPods Max deals Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max. The best AirPods 4 deals At its September event , Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments. The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app. Although they launched at the end of last year, we’ve consistently been seeing discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are on sale for $119 ($10 off) — about $20 shy of their all-time low — at Amazon , Walmart , and Staples . The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, meanwhile, are on sale at Walmart for $158.59 ($19 off), which is $10 shy of their best price to date. If you prefer a different retailer, you can also buy them for around $169 at Amazon and Staples . Read our full AirPods 4 review . The best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals In 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed up a year later with a minor refresh, one that features a USB-C charging case and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used with Apple’s new Vision Pro headset and doubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids . As far as deals go, Apple’s updated AirPods Pro with USB-C are currently available at Amazon and Walmart for $199 ($50 off), which is their typical sale price and a far cry from their all-time low of $153.99. Read our AirPods Pro with USB-C impressions . The best AirPods Max deals The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user. At the beginning of September, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a new model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. They’re currently on sale at Amazon and Walmart starting at $479.99 ($70 off), which is their second-best price to date and $30 shy of their all-time low. Keep in mind that you can also occasionally pick up the first-gen model for less than $400, but right now, we’re not seeing any deals of note on the original pair.

Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099.

Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest&nbsp;MacBook Pro. There’s a lot to like.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some good discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $837.19 ($163 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDC3WW5/\">Amazon</a>. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $1,049 ($150 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDBDCFH/?th=1\">Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"RdiMiF\">The best MacBook Pro deals</h2>\n\n<p>During its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23933672/apple-event-mac-october-news-updates-products-scary-fast\">“Scary Fast” event</a> in 2023, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24270706/apple-macbook-pro-m4-pro-max-14-16-announcement-specs\">M4-based machines in October 2024</a>, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"phB246\">M3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro</h3>\n\n<p>The entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23944344/apple-macbook-pro-14-2023-review-m3-specs-battery-ports\">14-inch M3 MacBook Pro</a> has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).</p>\n\n<p>The M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.</p>\n\n<p>We’re finding it challenging to spot the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock. However, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-pro-14-laptop-m3-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-18gb-memory-14-core-gpu-512gb-ssd-silver/6534616.p?skuId=6534616&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;utm_source=feed&amp;extStoreId=179\">Best Buy</a> is selling the 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 18GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 14-core GPU for $1,499 ($500 off).</p>\n\n<p>The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23949207/apple-macbook-pro-16-m3-max-review-price-specs\">the review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model</a>, which cost an eye-watering $7,199.</p>\n\n<p>But rest assured, versions that normal people are more likely to buy receive regular discounts. For instance, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going for $1,499 ($500 off) at <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1793624-REG/apple_mrx33ll_a_14_macbook_pro_with.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, which is a nice deal but nowhere near the lowest price we’ve seen previously.</p>\n\n<p>As for the base 16-inch Pro — which comes with an M3 Pro chip, 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD — it’s on sale starting at <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-pro-16-laptop-m3-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-18gb-memory-18-core-gpu-512gb-ssd-space-black/6534617.p\">Best Buy</a> for $1,899 ($500 off), which is its best price to date. <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-pro-16-laptop-m3-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-36gb-memory-18-core-gpu-512gb-ssd-space-black/6534625.p\">Best Buy</a> is also selling the 16-inch M3 Pro model with 36GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $2,299 ($500 off).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xG5TsE\">M4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro</h3>\n\n<p>Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks\"><strong>14-inch M4 MacBook Pro</strong></a> is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is opened. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.</p>\n\n<p>The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.</p>\n\n<p>Deals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD starts at $1,446 ($154 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHBYRPS?th=1\">Amazon</a>. Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,779 ($220 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY2BJ6\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859567-REG/apple_mx2h3ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m4.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,134 ($365 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-14%E2%80%91core-20%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLHDCN6P\">Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dJ3cdr\">The best Mac Mini deals</h2>\n\n<p>There’s a new Mac Mini in town, as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283861/apple-redesigned-mac-mini-macbook-pro-imac-m4-photos\">M4-based models arrived late last year</a>. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint on its desktop and paired it with its new M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cUuNKL\">M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini</h3>\n\n<p>Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review\">M4 Mac Mini</a> starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23762570/apple-mac-studio-m2-ultra-2023-review\">Mac Studio</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23770770/apple-mac-pro-m2-ultra-2023-review\">Mac Pro</a> when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the odd decision to place the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282752/the-magic-mouse-haters-are-going-to-have-a-field-day-with-this-one\">power button on its underside</a>, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, you can get the base Mac Mini at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLBTPDCS?th=1\">Amazon</a> with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $557 ($43 off).

Di Benedetto Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points. It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for newer models, but some retailers are still selling the last-gen laptop starting at $649 — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro . Purchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.

It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit. But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available. The best MacBook Air deals M1 MacBook Air The M1 MacBook Air was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and in brick-and-mortar stores. But while the redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air (which has been with us for a while as well) has taken over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in our guide to the best laptops . The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has committed to keeping it around for the foreseeable future and is currently discounting it to $649 ($350 off), which is $20 shy of its lowest price to date. M2 MacBook Air The M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn’t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it’s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads. It does have some slight downsides, though, including slower storage in the base 256GB configuration and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the best laptops . The M2-powered MacBook Air from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning. However, you can get the 13.6-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at Best Buy starting at $899 ($100 off), which is $50 shy of its all-time low price. If you don’t mind sacrificing some memory for extra storage, you can also get the 13-inch Air with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD at Best Buy for $799 ($200 off). It’s a bit harder to find discounts on the 15.3-inch MacBook Air M2, however. While it’s scantily in stock at some retailers for its original MSRP, you’d be better off going with a discounted M3 model. M3 MacBook Air The M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the M3 MacBook Air to exist.

You can also find the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) in select colors at Amazon . Given the $270 price difference between these two models, it’s great that you’re getting double the amount of internal storage. As for the M3-powered 15-inch MacBook Air, B&H Photo is selling the laptop for an all-time low of $999 ($300 off) with a 10-core GPU, 256GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM. You can also buy it with 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU for $1,299 ($200 off) at Best Buy . M4 MacBook Air Along with an updated Mac Studio , Apple recently announced a new MacBook Air , which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with a M4 processor. Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. There’s a lot to like. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some good discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $837.19 ($163 off) at Amazon . If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $1,049 ($150 off) at Amazon . The best MacBook Pro deals During its “Scary Fast” event in 2023, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October 2024 , and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts. M3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro The entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds). The M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup. We’re finding it challenging to spot the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock. However, Best Buy is selling the 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 18GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 14-core GPU for $1,499 ($500 off). The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited by the review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model , which cost an eye-watering $7,199. But rest assured, versions that normal people are more likely to buy receive regular discounts. For instance, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going for $1,499 ($500 off) at B&H Photo , which is a nice deal but nowhere near the lowest price we’ve seen previously. As for the base 16-inch Pro — which comes with an M3 Pro chip, 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD — it’s on sale starting at Best Buy for $1,899 ($500 off), which is its best price to date. Best Buy is also selling the 16-inch M3 Pro model with 36GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $2,299 ($500 off). M4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is opened. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option. Deals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD starts at $1,446 ($154 off) at Amazon . Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,779 ($220 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo . The base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,134 ($365 off) at Amazon . The best Mac Mini deals There’s a new Mac Mini in town, as M4-based models arrived late last year . Apple reduced the horizontal footprint on its desktop and paired it with its new M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value. M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep. In addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside , Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100. Right now, you can get the base Mac Mini at Amazon with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $557 ($43 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for around $729 ($70 off) at Amazon . Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale at Amazon starting at $1,286 ($114 off).",
